He lived there alone for many years, growing his plants and smoking pipe weed in a rate that would make Bilbo prowd. One god forsaken day, a specialist found out that there was a huge gold deposit below the surface of his farm's main field. Jebadaya was not interested in wealth and he sure wasn't gonna ruin his beautiful crops for some stupid glowing rocks.

Hearing of this unclaimed treasure, many miners and fortune seekers tried to tresspass his land and dig for gold. With no weapon aside his farmers sythes he chased and fought every one of them until they started coming at him with much more violent intentions. Funny thing about gold, it is always valuable, so for the remainder of his life he was forced to fight off countless reckless and greedy foes who tried to uproot him.

When Skipler secretly disposed of them (they were found forging in a medow two years later),he put a target on his back and armies of policemen and federal agents went after him.

They contacted the military which immediately contained him and turned him into a supersoldier. Impervious to bullets and with his hands strenth and swiftness he was unstoppable, the weapon that could not be countered. At last, an enemy military intelligence service decided that the best way to relieve themselves from Aye's threat was not to fight him. After some backround check they sent him an envelope that contained proof that the nuclear plant explosion that killed his family was an inside job by the current government to alleviate the past establishment. He fled the military and was not seen by anyone since. Every government member was strangled gruesomely under mysterious circumstances the folowing months. For years nobody knew his whereabouts until he became the worlds top noch bowler after Jesus Quintana."

There was no place he couldn't break into, and he always found his way out without no one even noticing what happened until it was too late. His heists where more of an art form than a crime (and some of them were really big crimes), and no bank or safe or secret was ever safe if his mind was set on aquiring it. One day he realized there was nothing worthwhile left to steal, and no worthy opponent to deny him. His eccentricity combined with his arrogance, led him to try and perform the ultimate last performance, for the looting of the prize he always yearned for. The ability to steal bodies! But only one being could posses a power like that. And that was Chan Chan! So after exhausting planning and preparing, he initiated the final heist, and managed to touch the orb that contained that power absorbing some of its essence before Chan Chan caught him. He found Arpin's struggle for stealing a microscopic insignificant fragment of his power funny, and he let him keep it just before he threw him in the D.I.E.N.A.M.O."
